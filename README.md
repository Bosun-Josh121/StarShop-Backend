### API Documentation

We use OpenAPI 3.0 with Swagger UI for API documentation.

To access the docs:

1. Start the server: `npm start`
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/docs`

### Updating Documentation

1. Edit the `openapi.yaml` file
2. Add/update endpoint documentation following OpenAPI spec
3. Restart the server to see changes
4. Validate schema: `npm run docs:validate`

### Generating Static Docs

Install Redoc CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g redoc-cli
```

Generate static HTML:

```bash
npm run docs:build
```

---

### üß™ 8Ô∏è‚É£ Testing

We use Jest for unit and integration testing. Ensure all new features include test coverage.

- `npm run test` - Run all tests.
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode during development.

**Unit Test Example:**  
Tests are located under the `src/tests` folder.  
Each service, utility, or feature should have a corresponding `*.spec.ts` file.
